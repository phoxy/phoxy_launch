Simple design. (By default it appending to "body" tag)
You could change target object by returning in main.php new field: "result".
Result means "id of object were i should be rendered".
NOTE: By this you REPLACING content of object, and you have no way to append.
(Except in next steps, when you will learn how to call your own JS functions)
